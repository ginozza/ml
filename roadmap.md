# ML Roadmap 2025

## What is ML?
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. The goal is to develop algorithms that can identify patterns, make decisions, and improve based on new data over time.

## Types of ML
1. **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms learn from labeled data and make predictions based on that knowledge.
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Algorithms identify patterns and relationships in unlabeled data.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms learn by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
